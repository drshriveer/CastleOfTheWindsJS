1) stage everything for a commit 

   git add path/to/file/to/add.js
   - OR - (if you're SURE you want to add everything)
   git add .

2) commit with message

   git commit -m "type message here"
   - OR - (better!)
   git commit
   type: "i"
   type: commit message
   type: esc key
   type: ":wq"  (:<- command, w <- write, q <- quit)
   type: enter key 

3) merge master into your branch
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   (this should fast forward, if not you were working on the wrong branch)
   git checkout theBranchYouWereWorkingOn (Robby)
   git merge master

4) resolve conflicts if any

   it will tell you where conflicts are and paste code 
   into files.. fix them as needed

5) stage & commit again (only if there were conflicts) 

   (steps 1 and 2 again)

6) push to your local branch 

   git push -u <origin or remote> < robby or custom branch>
