### Castle Of The Winds Javscript Port

This is the start of a Castle Of The Winds Javascript port created by [DrShriveer](http://github.com/drshriveer) and [RobertBowie](http://github.com/RobertBowie).

It has only just begun.... So please be patient.


#### Running the Server
1. Make sure you have [NPM](https://nodejs.org/download/) (Node Package Manager) installed.
2. Run the install `./install.sh` script to automate syncing packages
  * If you can't run the `install.sh` script just open it and run each command manually.
3. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
